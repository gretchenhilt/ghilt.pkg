This package is designed for some quick data cleaning and analysis for herpetological field biologists wanting a quick glance at their data before going in depth later on. For this package, data should include snout-vent-length and mass measurements, genus and species ID's, trap types, and any other data tailored to the researcher's interests and research goals.
